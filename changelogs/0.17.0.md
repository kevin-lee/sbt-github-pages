## [0.17.0](https://github.com/Kevin-Lee/sbt-github-pages/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20-label%3Arelease%20milestone%3Am21) - 2025-12-29

### New Features

* Fix: Publish fails if the gh-pages branch does not already exist (#113)
  * When `gitHubPagesBranchExists` is false, create the `gh-pages` branch (from `gitHubPagesBranch`)
  
    In general scenario, when running `sbt publishToGitHubPages`, if the `gh-pages` branch is missing,
    it creates the `gh-pages` branch before pushing files to it.
